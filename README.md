## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I have looked around for an easy to use and customizable text to speech script for Streamlabs Chatbot. The ones using the default voices installed in Windows sounded awful and other scripts weren't customizable enough.
With this at hand, I took the time to build a better text to speech script for Streamlabs Chatbot that uses Google voices and is way more customizable and easy to use.

Why is it better?
* Plug and play - Just ‚¨áÔ∏è download, üìÅ import, ‚úîÔ∏è enable and you are ready to go!
* All the configuration you need to trigger the TTS:
  * Command - !say, !tts, !speak or whatever your heart desires
  * Global and user cooldown - Limit the use for each user or/and all users with cooldown
  * Permission - Should everyone use the command? Regulars? Subs? you pick!
  * Cost - Set a cost for your command and spend Streamlabs Chatbot currency
* Don't want to use commands? Enable ‚úîÔ∏è*Read ALL chat* and read your entire chat!
* Make the voice unique with these configurations:
  * Language - Choose between 33 languages
  * Pitch - Custom pitch from super deep to extremely high pitched voice
  * Speed - Set your own talking speed from 75% to 250%
  * Volume - Volume separated from the Streamlabs Chatbot settings to meet your sound-fu requirements

Thanks to [@Tecno_Diana](https://www.twitch.tv/tecno_diana/) for coming up with the requirement.
